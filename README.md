# CoactionNet Request Signing Implementations

## Overview

This repo provides a collection of reference implementations of the CoactionNet request signing algorithm.  The purpose of these implementations is to provide guidance to developers tasked with integrating with the CoactionNet REST API. These implementations also serve as a means for validating your algorithm's output.  If the output from a custom signing algorithm matches that of any of these implementations, the algorithm can be assumed correct.
